| -------- | -------- | --------|  -------- |
| Padawans Task 1 | [#1](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-1) | In a small town initialPopulation is the population at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by some percents per year and moreover visitors (new inhabitants per year) come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to currentPopulation inhabitants? |
| Padawans Task 2 | [#2](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-2) | Implement the method Calculate(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first n elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer a, and a number of occurences of the given integer r, based on the element's position within the sequence. |
| Padawans Task 3 | [#3](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-3) | Implement the algorithm for finding the GCD of two integers. The integers can be large, so you need to find a clever solution. |
| Padawans Task 4 | [#4](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-4) | Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string. We will consider **a**, **e**, **i**, **o**, and **u** as vowels for this VowelCountTask. The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces. |
| Padawans Task 5 | [#5](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-5) | Implement the method CheckIfSymmetric() that takes an array of integers containing 0 and 1 as input and returns “Yes” or “No” depending on whether the given array is symmetric or not. |
| Padawans Task 6 | [#6](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-6) | Implement the method NextBiggerThan, which takes a positive integer number and returns the nearest largest integer consisting of the digits of the original number, and null if no such number exists. |
| Padawans Task 7 | [#7](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-7) | Implement the method OrderStringsByLength that sorts the source array of strings in ascending order of their length. |
| Padawans Task 8 | [#8](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-8) | Implement the method RemoveDuplicateWords that removes all duplicate words from string, leaving only single (first) words entries. By word we shall mean the unit that consists only of latin alphabet characters. Only following punctuation marks (. , ! ? - : ; ) and space characters can be delimiters between words. |
| Padawans Task 9 | [#9](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-9) | Implement the GetNeighbors method, which returns from a set of *points* only points that are *h*-neighbors for a *point* with integer coordinates *x* and *y*. The point *neighbor(xNeighbor, yNeighbor)* is *h*-neighbor for the given *point(x, y)* with a range *h* (*h* is an positive integer) if the coordinates of these points are such that \|xNeighbor - x\|<=h and \|yNeighbor - n\|<=h. The points resulting from sorting should not be sorted (in arbitrary order). |
| Padawans Task 10 | [#10](https://github.com/AnzhelikaKravchuk/PadawansTask-10) |  |
